# Customization

These themes make it easy to set up a colorful border for your presentation. Each has a default color, but's very easy to change without recompiling the theme.

Just add this CSS anywhere after you include the theme:

```css
.line {
  background: #<new-color>;
}
```

# Development

For deeper customization, you can make changes to the SCSS in order to build customized versions of these themes. See the instructions in the main [Reveal.js repo](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) for information on how to run and build themes - this repository is just a fork of that one.
